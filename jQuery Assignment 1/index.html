<div class="Step2">
  <p>When it comes to many aspects of your life, the mind is everything. If you believe in yourself, and you can picture yourself landing it, then you can. However, if you have any doubts before attempting the flip, it may cause you to panic in the air, and the results could be dangerous. Confidence is key, when you are 100% sure that you can do it, then your body will give it 100%.</p>

<div class="Step3">
  <p>Once you have cleared all the doubts in your mind, and you are ready to give it your all, then you can begin to take off. To properly take off, you need to do an explosive jump. In order to do this you must bend your knees and then jump at a 60Â° throwing your arms above your head as you take off.</p>

<div class="Step">
<h2>Step 4: Tuck and Spin</h2>
<button id="show4">Show</button>

<div class="Step4">
  <p>Once you have taken off and you are in the air, you must tuck your knees into your chest and place your hands on your knees. The trick with this is to not bring your arms to your knees, but to bring your knees to your arms, in order to spin faster. Once you have tucked, lean your heads backwards and allow your body to follow your head.</p>

<h2>Step 5: The Landing</h2>

<div class="Step5">
  <p>At the beginning, you may not always land on your feet, this comes with practice. However, the biggest fear that people have is landing on thier neck. But after following these steps, you can ensure that even though you may not land on your feet, you can atleast make the full rotation and not land on your neck. With practice, you can eventually teach yourself to spin faster until you land on your feet. At this point in order to prevent injury, you must absorb the landing. To properly absorb the landing, you need to bend your knees slightly when you land as if you are in a squatting position. </p>
