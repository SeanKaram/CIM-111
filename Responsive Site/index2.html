  <p>Long before Christopher Columbus set foot on the capital island, Grand Turk, the islands were inhabited by Taino and Lucayan people. These inhabitants settled mainly in Grand Turk and Middle Caicos. Shortly after Columbus discover the islands, the salt industry in the TCI grew enormously, as well as the cotton industry. However, due to the location of the TCI, the cotton industry began to decline because of the common amounts of hurricanes. In 1706, the Frensh and Spanish briefly captured the islands bringing many Dominican and Hatian people to the islands. Shortly after, there was conflict between TCI and the Bahamas, and of course, the French and Spanish managed to take over the Bahamas as well. At this time, the TCI became part of the Bahamas, and the British had not known much about these islands. Eventually, when the British found out about the islands, they were interested in the industries that the islands could offer, so they began to colonize the Bahamas and the TCI. The British won the war, and up until 1840, The Bahamas and the TCI remained as one individual country. However, the inhabitants petitioned on separating the countries and this was when they became their own countries, both under British colonization. But, in 1973, the Bahamas became independant. However, the TCI is still ruled by the British today, and it is considered a British overseas territory.

<p>Today, the TCI has developed greatly. Of course, the largest industry today is toursim because of how beautiful the islands are. However, the fishing industry in the TCI is also enormous, because of the large variety of sea life in the islands. There is also a large variety of culture in the TCI. Many people from Cuba, the DR, Haiti, the Bahamas, Jamaica, the Philipines, USA, Canada, and of course Britain, are currently living on the island. The TCI's population is 35,000, with 25,000 people living in Providenciales. Although Grand Turk is the capital of the TCI, Providenciales is the main island for tourism as it is the most devoloped and has the most beautiful beaches surrounding it. The main language of the Turks and Caicos is English, however, the many of the islanders do also speak Spanish and French. The TCI is one of the smallest countries in the world, being only 230 square miles, of pure beauty. The TCI is truly: Beautiful by Nature.
